# Personal Information We Collect

When you use our Services, you may provide to us, or we may collect,
Personal Information about you, your devices, and your use of the
Services to operate effectively and provide you with the best experience
with our Services, as described below.

In this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information
relating to an identified or identifiable individual. We collect various
types of Personal Information from or about you or your devices from
various sources. In some cases, if you choose not to provide the
requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use our Services.
We will tell you if providing the Personal Information is required by
law or under a contract and the consequences of failing to provide it.

## A. Personal Information You Provide to Us.

**Account Information**. We collect the Personal Information you provide
us for account creation and authentication, including but not limited to
your name, username, password, and email address. If you sign up using a
social media account (e.g., Google) or researcher credentialing web
services (e.g., ORCID), we will also receive Personal information from
those social media services, based on the privacy settings you applied
to these social media accounts.

**Attestation Documents.** If you wish to validate your user account to
be eligible to request access to certain functions, we may ask for
documentation intended to verify your credentials, such as a letter from
a signing official, a notarized letter, or a copy of your professional
license.

**Survey Information.** When you fill out a survey, we collect your
responses, which, depending on the survey type, may include products or
areas of interest, satisfaction, area of expertise, and agreement to
terms.

**Communications**. If you contact us directly, we collect any Personal
Information that you provide in your message to us. For example, when
you participate in our public forum or when you contact our Customer
Support Team at [<u>info@sagebase.org</u>](mailto:info@sagebase.org), we
will receive your name or username, email address, the contents of the
message, and any attachments that you may send to us. If you subscribe
to our newsletter, we will collect your email address. When we send you
emails, we track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better
customer experience and improve our Services.

**Careers.** If you decide to apply for a job with us, you may submit
your contact information, such as your name, email address, and phone
number, and your resume online. We will collect the Personal Information
you choose to provide on your resume, such as your education and
employment experience. You may also apply through career services such
as LinkedIn. If you do so, we will collect the Personal Information you
make available to us through these career services.

**Payment Information.** If you make a purchase through our Services or
donate money, we or our third-party payment processor collect and
process your payment-related information, such as your name, purchase
information, billing address, payment card information, and other
transaction information.

## B. Personal Information We Collect Via Automated Means.

We use technology to collect Personal Information automatically when you
use our Services that do not directly reveal your identity:

**Location Information**. When you use our Services, we infer your
general location information, such as your internet protocol (IP)
address.

**Device Information**. We receive Personal Information about the device
and software you use to access our Services, including IP address, web
browser type, operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer,
application installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising
identifiers, and push notification tokens.

**Usage Information**. To help us understand how you use our Services
and improve them, we automatically receive Personal Information about
your interactions with our Services, such as the pages or Content you
view, the searches you conduct, any Content you Post, and the dates and
times of your visits.

**Widget Information.** Other websites may integrate Sage’s widgets.
When you visit a site with a Sage widget embedded, we may receive
certain information, including information about the web page you
visited, your IP address, and other information about your device. Sage
and the widget can recognize you across websites containing Sage’s
widgets, and the widget may be used to show personalized content or
advertising. We know when you interact with a widget, and websites
containing the widgets may receive this information.

**User Feedback.** Users can rate and review each other, including
submitting comments and reactions to articles and posts published on our
Services. If you choose to provide feedback on the Services, that
information may be publicly viewable.

**Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies.** Cookies are small
text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. Log files
track actions that occur on the Services and collect device information.
Web beacons and pixel tags are electronic files that record usage
information. We and our third-party partners collect Personal
Information using cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies
(collectively, “**Cookies**”). Our third-party partners, such as
analytics partners, use these technologies to collect Personal
Information about your online activities over time and across different
services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies. A
session Cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent
Cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your
browser on subsequent visits to our Services. For more information on
our use of Cookies and how to exercise your choices with regard to these
Cookies, please see here \[Add link\].

Please review your web browser’s “Help” file to learn how you may modify
your Cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to
accept Cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the
features of the Service to their fullest potential.

## C. Personal Information We Receive from Third Parties. 

**Information from third-party services.** If you choose to link our
Services to a third-party account, we receive Personal Information about
you, including your user account information, photo, and use of the
third-party account. If you wish to limit the Personal Information
available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your
third-party accounts to learn about your options.

**Background Checks**. We work with third-party partners to perform
background checks on job applicants, and where permitted by applicable
law, receive publicly available information such as alias and address
history, and inclusion in several criminal national databases, sex
offender registries, or terrorist watchlists.

**Other third parties.** We may receive additional information about you
from third parties such as social media platforms like LinkedIn, blogs
like WordPress, and other publicly available databases, and may combine
it with other information we have about you.
