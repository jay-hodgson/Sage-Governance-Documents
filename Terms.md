Arbitration uses a neutralarbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a courtproceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and issubject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitratedisputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute,fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless ofwhether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, orenforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved bythe arbitrator.</p>
<p> YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND SAGE ARE EACH WAIVINGTHE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p><strong>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Exceptions.</strong> Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes    between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,    preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring    an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an    enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local    agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a    court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court    of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
<p><strong>19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding    arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19    (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date    that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Sage    Bionetworks, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 2901    Third Ave, Ste 330, Seattle, WA 98121 that specifies: your full    legal name, the email address associated with your account on the    Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration    (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong></ins>”).

The remaining    provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out    Notice.
<p><strong>19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitrator.</strong> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration    between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be    administered by JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes    (collectively, <span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>JAMS Rules</strong></ins>”) as modified by    these Terms.

<p><strong>19.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Commencing Arbitration.</strong> Before initiating arbitration, a party    must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party    by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required)    or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical    address, then by electronic mail (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Notice of    Arbitration</strong></ins>”). Sage<span dir="rtl">’</span>s address for Notice is:    <strong>Sage Bionetworks, 2901 Third Ave, Ste 330, Seattle, WA 98121, USA </strong>. The    Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number    of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of    the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought    (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Demand</strong></ins>”). The parties will make good faith    efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not    reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of    Arbitration is received, you or Sage may commence an arbitration    proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these    Terms, Sage will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,    unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the Sage has    received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case    the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the    arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the    relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper    purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of    Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be    governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek    reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.</p>
<p><strong>19.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration Proceedings.</strong> Any arbitration hearing will take place    in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise    or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek    injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be    conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the    arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an    in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or    parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any    settlement offer made by you or Sage must not be disclosed to the    arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and    award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is    conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision    sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on    which the decision and award, if any, are based.
<p><strong>19.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 19.8 (No Class    Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be    available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent    jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the    last written settlement amount offered by Sage before an arbitrator    was selected, Sage will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount    awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The    arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s award shall be final and binding    on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted    by law or (2) if the arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s award    includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which    case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the    injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall    not be bound by the arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s application    or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any    court having jurisdiction.
<p><strong>19.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND SAGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS    AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS    A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE    PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sage agree otherwise, the    arbitrator may not consolidate more than one    person<span dir="rtl">’</span>s claims, and may not otherwise    preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>19.9 &nbsp;&nbsp; Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Sage makes any    substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the    change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to    Sage<span dir="rtl">’</span>s address for Notice of Arbitration, in    which case your account with Sage will be immediately terminated and    this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the    changes you rejected will survive.</p>
<p><strong>19.10 &nbsp;&nbsp; Enforceability.</strong> If Section 19.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety    of this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to    be unenforceable, or if Sage receives an Opt-Out Notice from you,    then the entirety of this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution and    Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive    jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 (Governing Law)    will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
